[Moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)), the main subject of these exercises, are a great way to describe dists, but there's another  way: [maximum entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_entropy_probability_distribution#Other_examples), which, although important, we will not cover in detail.\n",
