They can't quite drive themselves yet, but even if they could, there's nothing stopping us from manually driving one off a cliff, warning lights be damned.\n",

Hopefully, this will be just as empowering as getting behind the wheel. Like a car has a complicated engine powering its capabilites, a pymc model has a complicated MCMC engine powering its capablities, and you don't really need to know how either work to take it for a drive.\n",
