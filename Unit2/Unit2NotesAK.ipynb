        " pymc is the library of functions we'll use to build our model, and it will underpin every model we'll build going forward. Imagine its like a car. Cars have all sorts of features now a days, from power steering and automatic transmission, to blind spot warnings and lane assist. They can't quite drive themselves yet, but even if they could, there's nothing stopping us from manually driving one off a cliff, warning lights be damned.\n",

        " We will learn how to avoid using our model to drive ourselves off a cliff, and we will also learn how to make use of its fancy bells and whistles. Hopefully, this will be just as empowering as getting behind the wheel. Like a car has a complicated engine powering its capabilites, a pymc model has a complicated MCMC engine powering its capablities, and you don't really need to know how either work to take it for a drive.\n",

        "\n",
        "In writing down our assumptions, we found it necceesary to think mathematically about probability and the physical act of FT shooting. This led us to probability density functions (pdf) as a good summary of our knowledge.\n",

        "Instead of stopping there, we saw that we could alter our assumption by processing new information through with a likelihood, another pdf.\n",
        "\n",
        "We then combined our new information with our prior knowledge by multipying our pdfs. This gave us a way to make a guess post new information, and we called this a posterior.\n",
        "\n",
        "And this posterior *is* our answer. It can give us different precise estimates, like the mean, median, and mode, and gives us a probability for all the values Wembanyama's truw FT% could be.\n",
        "\n",
        "But we didn't stop there! Our analytic solution happened to work out well mathematically, but we want a tool that works nearly everytime.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, we took out a pymc model for a test drive. We played a bit with its many metaphorical knobs and buttons to get predictions for Wembanyama's future FTs.\n",
