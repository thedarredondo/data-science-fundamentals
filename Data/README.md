# Data
Any data set used in the notes lives here.

If you want to find interesting datasets, Osvaldo Martin (the author of the textbook for this course) recommends:
- [world bank](https://data.worldbank.org/) 
- [https://users.stat.ufl.edu/~winner/datasets.html](https://users.stat.ufl.edu/~winner/datasets.html).

I've also linked a classic Machine learning repository; it has some text and image data which probably won't be of use to you, but some of the other data sets might be helpful.

This last resource requires a bit more work on your part. It has links to various free sources of data, with varying levels of cleanliness. 
Basically, the data is probably useful, but it will likely take some effort to put it in a useful format.

Oh, and a note on kaggle, which you will likely run into: about 80% of the data on kaggle is hot trash. Maybe more. That said, there are some hidden gems amidst the refuse.

One last discussion: I had planned to link to various federal government websites, as they used to be the best soruces of  free, clean, and useful data--at least, before trump.
Now, I hesitate to include any of the websites on hear, since that data could be taken down at any time. I'm not even sure the data there will be reliable much longer; as of this writing, trump fired a Bureau of Labor Statistics statistician (and the head of the burea) for honestly reporting labor market statistics.

I brought in politics for two reasons:
- Learning, even mathematical learning, is liberal; it requires the free and open flow of information.
- We must always take the context in which data was collected into consideration.
